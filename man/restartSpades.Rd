\title{Restart an interrupted simulation}
\usage{
restartSpades(
  sim = NULL,
  module = NULL,
  numEvents = Inf,
  restart = TRUE,
  verbose = getOption("reproducible.verbose", 1L),
  ...
)

saveState(filename, ...)

restartOrSimInitAndSpades(ll, file, reset = getOption("spades.resetRestart"))
}
\arguments{
\item{sim}{A \code{simList} or a filename that will load a \code{simList}, e.g., from
\code{saveState} or \code{saveSimList}. If not supplied (the default),
this will take the \code{sim} from
\code{savedSimEnv()$.sim}, i.e., the one that was interrupted}

\item{module}{A character string length one naming the module that caused the error and
whose source code was fixed. This module will be re-parsed and placed into the \code{simList}}

\item{numEvents}{Numeric. Default is Inf (i.e., all available).
The number of events to be rewound.
In the \code{simList}, if \code{options('spades.recoveryMode')} is set to \code{TRUE} or a numeric,
then there will be a list in the \code{simList} called \code{.recoverableObjs}.
These will be replayed backwards in time to reproduce the initial state of the \code{simList}
before the event that is \code{numEvents} prior to the first event in \code{events(sim)}.}

\item{restart}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the call to \code{spades} will be made, i.e.,
restarting the simulation. If \code{FALSE}, then it will return a new \code{simList}
with the module code parsed into the \code{simList}}

\item{verbose}{Logical or Numeric, follows \code{reproducible.verbose} value by default.}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{spades}, e.g., \code{debug}, \code{.plotInitialTime}}

\item{filename}{The filename to save the sim state.

\code{saveState} is a wrapper around \code{restartSpades} and \code{saveSimList}. You can
pass arguments to the \code{...} that will be passed to \code{saveSimList}, such as
\code{modules}, \code{inputs}, \code{outputs}.}

\item{ll}{A list of elements that would be passed to \code{simInit}, such as \code{modules}.}

\item{file}{An optional file that has a saved \code{simList}, e.g., from \code{saveSimList}
or \code{saveState}.}

\item{reset}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then it will force \code{simInitAndSpades} to be called
even if there is saved \code{sim} available.}
}
\value{
A \code{simList} as if \code{spades} had been called on a \code{simList}.

A \code{simList}, that has been "executed" until \code{end(sim)}, if it does not
hit an error.
}
\description{
\strong{This is experimental and has not been thoroughly tested. Use with caution.}
If there is an error during an event, this function will rewind the simulation to a state
\code{numEvents} prior to the event that led to the error. The developer may then modify the
source code of the module that caused the break and resume the simulation.
}
\details{
If \code{options('spades.recoveryMode')} is set to \code{TRUE} or a numeric (default 1), then
there will be a list in the \code{simList} called \code{.recoverableObjs}.
These record the elements of simList that have  changed over a number of events equal
to the number chosen for \code{options('spades.recoveryMode')}.
The \code{restartSpades} function then uses this list to rewind \code{numEvents} backwards from the
first event in \code{events(sim)} (likely the one that caused the error).

The random number seed will be reset to the state it was at the start of the
earliest event recovered, thereby returning to the exact stochastic simulation trajectory.
}
\note{
The \code{simList} will be in the state it was \code{numEvents} prior to the event
that led to the error (although some objects, e.g., on disk, may have already been modified).

\examples{
\donttest{
# options("spades.recoveryMode" = 1) # now the default
s <- simInit()
s <- spades(s) # if this is interrupted or fails
# the following line will not work if the previous line didn't fail
s <- restartSpades(s) # don't need to specify `sim` if previous line fails
                     # will take from savedSimEnv()$.sim automatically
