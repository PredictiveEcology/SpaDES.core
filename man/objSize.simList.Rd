\title{Object size for \code{simList}}
\usage{
\method{objSize}{simList}(x, quick = FALSE, recursive = FALSE, ...)
}
\value{
an estimate of the size of the object, in bytes.
}
\description{
Recursively, runs \code{\link[reproducible:objSize]{reproducible::objSize()}} on the \code{simList} environment,
so it estimates the correct size of functions stored there (e.g., with their enclosing
environments) plus, it adds all other "normal" elements of the \code{simList}, e.g.,
\code{objSize(completed(sim))}.
The output is structured into 2 elements: the \code{sim} environment and all its objects,
and the other slots in the \code{simList} (e.g., events, completed, modules, etc.).
The returned object also has an attribute, "total", which shows the total size.

\examples{
a <- simInit(objects = list(d = 1:10, b = 2:20))
objSize(a)
utils::object.size(a)
