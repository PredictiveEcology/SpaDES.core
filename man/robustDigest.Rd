\title{\code{.robustDigest} for \code{simList} objects}
\usage{
\S4method{.robustDigest}{simList}(object, .objects, length, algo, quick, classOptions)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object to digest.}

\item{.objects}{Character vector of objects to be digested. This is only applicable
if there is a list, environment (or similar) with named objects
within it. Only this/these objects will be considered for caching,
i.e., only use a subset of
the list, environment or similar objects. In the case of nested list-type
objects, this will only be applied outermost first.}

\item{length}{Numeric. If the element passed to Cache is a \code{Path} class
object (from e.g., \code{asPath(filename)}) or it is a \code{Raster} with
file-backing, then this will be
passed to \code{digest::digest}, essentially limiting the number of bytes
to digest (for speed). This will only be used if \code{quick = FALSE}.
Default is \code{getOption("reproducible.length")}, which is set to \code{Inf}.}

\item{algo}{The algorithms to be used; currently available choices are
    \code{md5}, which is also the default, \code{sha1}, \code{crc32},
    \code{sha256}, \code{sha512}, \code{xxhash32}, \code{xxhash64},
    \code{murmur32}, \code{spookyhash} and \code{blake3}.}

\item{quick}{Logical. If \code{TRUE},
little or no disk-based information will be assessed, i.e., mostly its
memory content. This is relevant for objects of class \code{character},
\code{Path} and \code{Raster} currently. For class \code{character}, it is ambiguous
whether this represents a character string or a vector of file paths. The function
will assess if it is a path to a file or directory first. If not, it will treat
the object as a character string. If it is known that character strings should
not be treated as paths, then \code{quick = TRUE} will be much faster, with no loss
of information. If it is file or directory, then it will digest the file content,
or \code{basename(object)}. For class \code{Path} objects, the file's metadata
(i.e., filename and file size) will be hashed instead of the file contents if
\code{quick = TRUE}.
If set to \code{FALSE} (default), the contents of the file(s) are hashed.
If \code{quick = TRUE}, \code{length} is ignored. \code{Raster} objects are treated
as paths, if they are file-backed.}

\item{classOptions}{Optional list. This will pass into \code{.robustDigest} for
specific classes. Should be options that the \code{.robustDigest} knows what
to do with.}

\description{
This is intended to be used within the \code{Cache} function, but can be used to evaluate what
a \code{simList} would look like once it is converted to a repeatably digestible object.
}
\details{
See \code{\link[reproducible]{robustDigest}}.
This method strips out stuff from a \code{simList} class object that would make it otherwise not
reproducibly digestible between sessions, operating systems, or machines.
This will likely still not allow identical digest results across R versions.
