\usage{
downloadModule(name, path, version, repo, data, quiet, quickCheck = FALSE,
  overwrite = FALSE)


  \S4method{downloadModule}{character,character,character,character,logical,logical,ANY,logical}(name,
  path, version, repo, data, quiet, quickCheck = FALSE, overwrite = FALSE)


  \S4method{downloadModule}{character,missing,missing,missing,missing,missing,ANY,ANY}(name,
  quickCheck)

\S4method{downloadModule}{character,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY,ANY}(name, path,
  version, repo, data, quiet, quickCheck = FALSE, overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Character string giving the module name.}

\item{path}{Character string giving the location in which to save the
downloaded module.}

\item{version}{The module version to download. (If not specified, or \code{NA},
the most recent version will be retrieved.)}

\item{repo}{GitHub repository name, specified as \code{"username/repositoryname"}.
Default is \code{"PredictiveEcology/SpaDES-modules"}, which is
specified by the global option \code{spades.moduleRepo}.
Only \code{master} branches can be used at this point.}

\item{data}{Logical. If TRUE, then the data that is identified in the module
metadata will be downloaded, if possible. Default if FALSE.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. This is passed to \code{download.file} (default \code{FALSE}).}

\item{quickCheck}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the check with local data will only
use \code{file.size} instead of \code{digest::digest}.
This is faster, but potentially much less robust.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Should local module files be overwritten in case they exist?
Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list of length 2. The first element is a character vector containing
   a character vector of extracted files for the module. The second element is
   a \code{tbl} with details about the data that is relevant for the function,
   including whether it was downloaded or not, and whether it was renamed
   (because there was a local copy that had the wrong file name).
}
\description{
Download a .zip file of the module and extract (unzip) it to a user-specified location.
}
\details{
Currently only works with a public GitHub repository, where modules are in
a \code{modules} directory in the root tree on the \code{master} branch.
Module .zip files' names should contain the version number and be inside their respective module folders
- see \code{zipModule} for zip compression of modules.
}
\note{
\code{downloadModule} uses the \code{GITHUB_PAT} environment variable
if a value is set. This alleviates 403 errors caused by too-frequent downloads.
Generate a GitHub personal access token at \url{https://github.com/settings/tokens}.

The default is to overwrite any existing files in the case of a conflict.
