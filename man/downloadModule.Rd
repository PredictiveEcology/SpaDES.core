\arguments{
\item{name}{Character string giving the module name.}

\item{path}{Character string giving the location in which to save the
downloaded module.}

\item{version}{The module version to download. (If not specified, or \code{NA},
the most recent version will be retrieved.)}

\item{repo}{GitHub repository name, specified as \code{"username/repo"}.
Default is \code{"PredictiveEcology/SpaDES-modules"}, which is
specified by the global option \code{spades.moduleRepo}.
Only \code{master}/\code{main} branches can be used at this point.}

\item{data}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the data that is identified in the
module metadata will be downloaded, if possible. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{quiet}{Logical. This is passed to \code{download.file} (default \code{FALSE}).}

\item{quickCheck}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then the check with local data will only
use \code{file.size} instead of \code{digest::digest}.
This is faster, but potentially much less robust.}

\item{overwrite}{Logical. Should local module files be overwritten in case they exist?
Default \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A list of length 2. The first element is a character vector containing
a character vector of extracted files for the module. The second element is
a \code{tbl} with details about the data that is relevant for the function,
including whether it was downloaded or not, and whether it was renamed
(because there was a local copy that had the wrong file name).
}
\description{
Download a .zip file of the module and extract (unzip) it to a user-specified location.
}
\details{
Currently only works with GitHub repositories where modules are located in
a \code{modules} directory in the root tree on the \code{master} branch.
Module .zip files' names should contain the version number and be inside their
respective module folders (see \code{\link[=zipModule]{zipModule()}} for zip compression of modules).
}
\note{
\code{downloadModule} uses the \code{GITHUB_PAT} environment variable
if a value is set. This alleviates 403 errors caused by too-frequent downloads.
Generate a GitHub personal access token with no additional permissions at
\url{https://github.com/settings/tokens}, and add this key to \file{.Renviron}
as \verb{GITHUB_PAT=<your-github-pat-here>}.

The default is to overwrite any existing files in the case of a conflict.
