# Advanced `SpaDES` use

## Memory monitoring

While `profvis::profvis` is an essential tool for memory monitoring using deep R internals, it is often not sufficient for a discrete event situation.
For example, it may be useful to know the *peak memory use* of an event, as this may be the limiting step for setting up many parallel instances. There is an experimental tool that gets triggered with `options("spades.memoryUseInterval" = xxx)` where `xxx` is a `numeric` in seconds, e.g., `0.2`. If this is set, and `future` and `future.callr` are installed, then whenever a `spades` call is made, the memory use will be assessed at that regular interval. The procedure is:

1) spawn a future session (i.e., a parallel session) that runs `system('ps')` which lists all processes. It only keeps the process that represents the process ID of the main rsession.

2) that `ps` call writes to a text file every `getOption('spades.memoryUseInterval')`

3) if you ran this with a `spades` call, setting `options("spades.memoryUseInterval" = 0.5)` or some other interval (in seconds), it will read that txt file into the simList at the end/`on.exit` of the `spades` call. _Doing this triggers a file deletion of the txt file_.

4) the object is then in `sim$.memoryUse$obj`

At that point, the function `memoryUse` can be called on the `simList` and it will do a join on the `sim$.memoryUse$obj` with the `completed(sim)` *by* time stamp, so each event shows its memory use.


```{r memoryUse, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(reproducible)
Require("future") # install it if necessary
Require("future.callr") # install it if necessary
options("spades.memoryUseInterval" = 0.5)

# run your simInit and spades calls here
# sim <- simInit()
# sim <- spades(sim)  

memoryUse(sim, max = TRUE) # this should show peak memory use by eventType -- i.e., summarizes if multiple times
memoryUse(sim, max = FALSE) # this should show peak memory use by event
```
